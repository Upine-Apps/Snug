6.) The next button in the walkthrough section has been moved up a little bit
    -- For all the homies using iOS.

7.) After marking your date as safe a popup will display in the home screen to confirm

8.) All popup colors have been changed to help stand out from background color
    -- Our UI guy might be color blind ;)

    -- This should help users know which drop down is for what.
