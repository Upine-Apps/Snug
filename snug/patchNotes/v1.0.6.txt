Patch Notes for Snug 1.0.6

1) Fixed account deletion bug
    -- This bug only showed if you created a new account and immediately went to delete it without signing out and signing into the app.
    -- Nobody probably would've noticed this.
    -- It aint much, but it's honest work.
    

2) Fixed issue where autofill for searched location was failing
    -- The autofill dropdown when searching for a location would not show. 
    -- Why did nobody tell us this?

3) Fixed bug where a second back button would display in the forgot password screen
    -- If you found this bug, gold star for you.
    -- Only occurred if you created a date, signed out, then clicked forgot password.
    
4) There is now one space between first and last name in the profile page
    -- Weird, it’s like the devs don’t know coding.

5) Fixed bug where the name of the date was cut out on the detailed date page
    -- Do not know how it got there buts fixed

6) The first character of every text field is now auto capitalized
    -- One of our best features :)

7) Zip code now limits to 5 digits everywhere
